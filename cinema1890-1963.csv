E. B. BALDWINS PLAN TO DRIFT ACROSS THE ARCTIC OCEAN, WHILE CAMPED UPON THE ICE PACK, C^R
. 9
FOUR -YE All TRIP OA ICE.
While Drifting Across Arctic Bald
win Will Raise Vegetables.
Novel plans for wresting the final sec-rots of
the Arctic regions have been made by Evelyn
Briggs Baldwin. The venturesome explorer pur
poses on his next expedition to drift straight
■cross the uncharted Arctic sea aboard an
lee island several times the size of Central Park.
Established on his island, with portable bouses,
ponies, dops, tons of whale meat and equipment,
be will not care much what happen* to the ship
that brought him there. The ship may be
crushed: it will not matter. During the four
years of drifting from Bering Strait to the
other side of th? world, at the rate of two miles
a day, th« diet of canned food, sea shrimps,
grills, walrus and bear meat will naturally be
conn monotonous. Tin members of the expedi
tion will crave and nee«l fresh vegetables. How
car, they lie had in th« frozen wastes of the
Par North? .Mr. Baldwin plans to raise vegetables
right ""i: thai in island. He will have a garden
patrh. with artificial soil ami artificial heat sup
plementing the ray? of a six months' sun. and
will raise onions and ■ • ! nagr< - in dose proximity
to the N< rth Poll To farm 01 ice and plant

suddenly drop '.i- deprees below zen is a feat
that noiu but a scientific agriculturist would
attempt.
Mr. Baldwin titends to us« captive and diri-
Kit. l' balloons as accessories to scientific obser
vation?, while .'. wireless telegraph outfit will
keep him in touch with civilization through an
Intermediate station in Alaska. Th< dirigible
balloons may furnish .' means of escape to the

The wireless system will inform the world v, hat

cinema tograph will take pictures «.f scenes and
Incidents of interest or importance.
""Starting in the late summer for i ring
Btrait,' said Mr. Baldwin to a Tribune reporter,
""my plan is to have our expedition hi] com

oil, foods, clothing and the extensiv< equipment

Ice. We will make directly for tin edge of the
pack ice to th* northwest of Point Barrow,
Ah. : . and will tie i:p alongside the most prom

73 north and longitude ICS west, or about one
hundied miles east of the point of besetrnent
of the Jeannette, or CO degrees east cf the point

Are Stage and Cinema
Art's Siamese Twins?
By LAWRENCE REAMER.
It. is 1101 Jlattorins to national pride that a piny by a native author
dealing with ono of the great llguros of American history should
have been rejected nfter n brief hearing while nn Englishman's drama
ot the life of n later hero is still In the hish tide of Its success The scene
I'ercy Mncknyc's ""Washington"" are the shrines of American history.
Mount Vernon, the Delaware, at Trenton, Valley Torse and Yorktown
these holy to the American patriot, especially when the dominating figure
of George Washington looms against their sacred background. Could an
American playwright, with the assistance of other arts thnt serve the '
theatre, fail to interest his countrymen in this theme? '
Evidenly Mr. Mackaye was er.ual to the task. Critics so old fashioned
as to defer to subloet nnd niirnose In nnv artistic seliemn wbleb Is sn bU.
torical In its nature as this one was felt the necessity of u mood to appre
ciate. The attempt won sympathy. It was altogether worthy in the best
sense of the word. Maybe for that reason Its complete failure seemed the ;
aore deplorable and, moreover, the less excusable. But nobody could
deny to any author setting out with such a purpose rtv aid of sympathetic 1
appreciation. Thai It was altogether unavailing in tills literary calamity
does not make the desire to extend the glad hand any less commendable.
It seems that nfter all ""Washington"" failed more on account of its
c'ort at humor than any weakness in dealing with the moments of serious
.""tercet. Why should every effort, at folk interest, either In story or sonj,
so often become morel jr silly? The old ballad singer Quitloquon was a
hopeless ninny throughout every scene la which ho appeared. When he
Mounted a hobby horse and with the two children sang ""Yankee Doodle""
the bottomless pit of idiocy seemed to be fathomed. Maybe In the vnst
nes of an out of door spectacle there might be room for something of the
kind, but in a playhouse the effect Is cruel. Throughout the play there
were a dignity and sincerity in tne serious episodes wiucii mlgiit have
gainml a toleration for the work. Yet these were followed Invariably by
tome outbreak of inanity from the appalling QuiUoqunn and the day was lost,
completely lost.
Tlio cinema prows closer to the
theatre In its business relations at least,
and while these may not bo the sub
ject for comment from those who are
supposed to view the artistic fcldo of
tlio theatre nlone, there Is an cxcub
ablo relation between tho two. Just
now it is the call of tho popular cinema
Jnimes to the stage that seems newest
In theatro enterprise. Tho scheme
seems to 1m? no more than a. reversal of
tlio process of transferring tho well
known artors of the theatre to the
studio, which was ono support of the
pieturo play in its earlier days.
It needs no such support nowadays.
It is doubtful if tho aid was ever more
than nominal slnco tho players who
havo learned their technic on the
spoken staco were never the most
popular before the camera. Tho mimes
who smllo and weep, leap or shoot be--foro
tho camera Just as they were
taught to do by their first director are
nfter all the best liked by their public.
They do their duties according to the
technic of tho picture play and that Is
after nil most effective in tho circum
stances. Now the technic of the pic
ture aetor is to bo brought before tho
theatre spectators. This 1st Just enough,
slnco the technic of tho other plays
was in tho first Instance nil that was
available for rfo cinema in Its incep
tion. So the change is fair.
I'rom Screen to Since.
Presumably it is tho technic of tho
nhotocrnphio stago which Miss Theda
llara exhibits in ""Tho Hlun name.""
It is of course out of its placeJYct
ono must say that if such be the
jiractice of tho picture player In the
spoken drama it is not different in do
tails from tho methods of the amateur.
In her performance there was no trace
of professional certainty or skill from
tho use of well understood means. It
was altogether colorless. Probably
with tho sensational conditions of this
play, nlready cooled off, sho will never
bo called on to act again in the spoken
drama. She reveals not the slightest
excuse for a placo on tho stage.
But there will inevitably bo rfuc
cossors to tho popular adulation of
Miss Elsie Ferguson and Mls3 Bara.
David Belasco already confesses tbat
bo has cast his eyo on Miss Mary
j'lckford. It will bo interesting to see
how much he accomplishes with the
most noted flguro In ono medium of
i cprcscntatlon who had gained little
rr no measure of success in tho other.
In tho mcantimo tho interest In Its
celluloid stars transferred to the the
niio continues unabated. ""Sacrcl and
j'roiano i-ove"" was tolerated out a
few nights In London. Arnold Ben
nett's play met there with swift re
jection. Hero there eeems no possi
bility of satisfying tho public deslro to
tee tho drama. Of course it Is not this
Inept, drawn out specimen of amateur
dramaturgy which is attracting the
thousands. Nor is it the admirable
nctlng of Jose Ruben as tho afflicted
pianist. It seems to bo .nothing moro
nor less than a deslro to gee tho loxoly
Miss Ferguson after her long Impr's-

not to bo disputed that tho form of
tho art Is simple. It is expressed In
one medium. It is even Independent
of speech and of song, whereas both
drama and opera' aro not so self-contained.
Music in the revelation o, a
so-called pieturo play is Incidental,
not in tho least essential. But rpeeeb
and music aro indispensable to drama
and opera. Tne cinema may exist by
itn own medium alone.
And It is in this form that it Is
most admirable. Any union of tho
two is nearly always fatal. We had
the cinema dramaturgy in ""Thrco
Faces East,"" for Instance, and were
surprised at first by its swiftness, gen
eral obscurity and altogether incom
prehensible thrills. All tho writers of
melodrama- were temporarily affected
by this gift of speech to the scenario.
Even ns expert a writer as Samuel
Shipman tried tho process In ""Tho
Woman in Hoom 13."" Its general effect
was to put the characters In the story
before the public In silhouette rather
than in the round. But its vogue
passed away and when Paul Anthony
Kelly tried the trick once moro in
""Tho Phantom Legion"" its old power
was gone. Tho transfer to tho spoken
stage of the actresses who havo be
come popular in these picture plays is
but a temporary phase of tho frequent
attempts to unite tho two arts. They
are never happy In the event. ""The
Bluo Flame"" contains scenes that
might set an audience tingling with
excitement wero they shown as moving
photographs. As acted and spoken
drama, however, they arouso derisive
laughter. They aro no moro engross
ing than ""Tho Queen of tho Opium
Iling,"" which A. H. Woods used to
offer to tho patrons of his melodramas,
and ho would not think of bringing
out one of them now.
To Act for thr Tear Dnet.
Tlio return of Miss P.lanche Yurka
o the local stage is a reminder of tlio
slight patience which theatregoers of
tho present day feel for tho repre
sentation of so-called ""emotional""
scones. Miss Yurka Is an altogether
ndmlrablo actress In such parts. Sho
can Impersonate feminine distress nat
urally, without exaggeration and with
appealing simplicity of method. Sho
established her ability in this field so
long ago as the production of ""Day
break"" at tho Harris Theatre. Thero
was a time when tho possession of
such talents would have won hor an
exalted position en tho stago of this
country. Sho Is not tho only woman
to realize that, after all, the kind of
talents that were so much appreciated
In tho past do not carry an actress far
to-day nor establish her firmly In the
theatre world.
Miss Dorothy Donnelly acted tho
title rolo In "".Mine. X."" in a way that
would In tho days of the great popu
larity of tho hysterical Gallic drama
havo put her In tho first rank of
American actresses. Y'ct when the
voguo of tho play camo to on end
there was Uttlo memory of the fa-
onment. It can ocarcely be Bald that rnous achievement. Emily Anna Well
this actress, popular as she is, In
creased her admirers by appearing In
tho cinema. There is nothing demo
cratic about the prices at the Morosco
Theatre. They hover about the top
notch. So It is not her new puoilc
accumulated in a cheap priced movlo
world that Is turning out so loyally.
Jt Is tho theatregoer able to pay for
what he wants.
The view of the cinema is moro en
couraging In Its own direct form than
In any relation to the theatre. It Is
man In ""The Guilty Man"" at the Astor
Theatre three yoirs ago played In re
markably effcctlvo manner a brief
scene of fevered emotional stress. Sho
would also in tho past havo been
made cnduringly fomous by such an
accomplishment. Tho memory of
Nance O'Xell's brilliant acting In ""Tho
Lily"" departed with tho play.
But tho progress of theso actresses
would In the past have been simple
Having shown the ability to play such
roles, others would have been found at

once to carry further tho possibilities,
commercial and artistic, of such a
talent. There would havo been Mar
guerite (lautlcr awaiting representa
tion at the hands of tho new actress.
Then dilbcrtc would havo wept for in
terpretation by tho newcomer whoso
conception of JIss Multon would havo
been eagerly awaited. Then Juliet and
tho rest of the roles that marked her
ascent to final Importance would havo
been expected In duo time. In that
day, tho, way of tho actress of such
gifts was easy.
But that was the day of the actor
This i3 tho day of tho dramatist. Au
diences in tlio past were willing to see
life then through tho eyes of the actor.
So these women chiefly outsldo the
Shakespearean repertoire, tho creation
of tho French playwrights of tho lato
70s and 80s, attracted tho attention
of tho public through the skill of their
Interpreters not from any pieturo ofj
llfo which they offered. Soon nfter;
Nora Hchncr appeared on tho scene!
interest In them waned. They wero'
succeeded so far ns tho stage of this:
country went by such women ns Paula
Tanqueray and Magda Schwartz, whoi
might to-day havo been compelled to
make her way In tho theatro world
with the handicap of such a name as
Haggle Black. Already the day of tho
actor was drawing to a close and tho
dramatist was feeling his preponder
ance. Miss Jane Cowl In tho present gen
eraiton of actresses succeeded best in
holding her public through the appeal
to the tear duct. But after her ap
pearance in such parts which hap
pened to too In successful plays, for a
short time, the actress realized that
comedy was moro In the mood of the
public at this time. So her popularity
Is probably for that reason greater
than ever. How much more difficult.
moreover, is tho task of the comedi
enne. Miss Cowl has become nn adept
in comcy and acts with equal skill
in both phases of her art. Miss Emily
Stevens, on tho other hand, in her
attempts at tho delicacy of comedy
artificial comedy at that, does no more
than impress tho tipectator with hor
skill as an actress of dramatic char
acters. One need not touch tho seri
ous ladles, to begin with, so lightly.
Ono may, indeed, pound somewhat
heavily on the emotions and yet do no
harm to illusion.
But tho playing of comedy as it is
acted, for Instance, in the present day
by MLss Mario Tempest, scarcely an
actress of this generation Is more deli
cate and feathery, more polished and
subtle than tho portrayal of tho deeper
emotions. Possibly it is in reality
much moro of an art with less than
tho natural force to depend on- Yet
oven tho best of tho great ones of the
past wero often Judged rather by their
acting of tlio lighter phases of famous
characters than by the more rerious.
Mme. Helena Modjoska, for instance,
won tho admiration of critics in ""La
Damo aux Camellias"" more by her
delicato playing of tho light comedy
episodes to bo found In tho original
play than by her manner of taking
the regulation hurdles. So the genius
i of high comedy lms always bsn suf
ficiently respected, although the emo
tional actress was more honored in
tho past than sho is to-day.

DUBLIN, July 29.—There is a re
: newed agitation in Ireland for the re
! lease from prison of James Larkin,
j now serving a sentence in America.
Some of the new’ town councils have
taken up the matter, and are busy
passing resolutions about it.
f At Mullinger the town council de
: manded Larkin's release, and Mr.
Brett, a member of the county council,
said that, as Larkin was an Irish cit
j izen any communication with refer
; ence to him from the American gov
: err.ment should be made through the
: Irish republican government and he I
| thought that the matter should be
placed in the hands of the minister for
foreign affairs of the Irish republi
jean government. Other Irish councils

You who go to see motion pictures
'feel that, the studio must be- a verit
able wonderland, and the life of a mo
tion picture star heaven on earth, Jo
you not V Most people do, for the rea
son thut everything unfamiliar seems
wonderful.
Would >’ou like to be taken behind
the scenes of a studio, see how motion
pictures are made, see what a terrible
and heart-breaking struggle is olten
necessary for success.
If you would, you must sec ‘‘The
Cinema Murder,"" with Marion Davies,
a Cosmopolitan Production, which will
be at tbe Palace airdome tomorrow.
This is a Paramount-Artcraft. picture,
and it ran in the Cosmopolitan Maga
/ine. K. Phillips Oppenheiin wrote it.
It’s a popular book as well.
It’s the story of a motion picture
actress. You see tier in the studio,
you see scenes taken, you see the
whole inside life of the motion pic
ture artist. And you will realize that
success is not all glory and money’, but
is often accompanied by heart-aches
and suffering.
It’s powerfully dramatic, entertain
ing and thrilling from the very begin
ning. It’s one of those pictures that
no motion picture lover wants to miss.
We know you will come. Bring your
friends.
CANTU IS SURE
(Continued from Page One)
will have but little trouble in with
standing the coming attack.
With the arrival of the troops still
some days distant more and more cit
izens are volunteering for service in
Cantu’s army and by the time of the
attack it is expected that his army
will have achieved no inconsiderable
size.
In common with the general shift
ing of troops to the border the air
service students encamped at Puryeav
field near here have been sent to San
Diego under sealed orders, where it is
anticipated that they will be rushed
to the border for action should oc
casion arise. About 40 men left here
in transports and small cars, leaving
behind them but about one squad of
soldiers, who may be rushed either to
San Diego or Calexico at any time.
CANTU GETS SUPPORT
(Ey Associated Press)
MEXICALI, July 29.—Governor
Cantu announced the receipt of tele-1
grams from al over the district pledg-,
ing support to his plans to resist oc- j
cupation by’ the 3,000 soldiers of the
Mexican federal government who are
reported on their way to the district.
The telegrams assured assistance to
the end. Both the governor and his
staff were up at 5 this morning work
ing on the plans of defense.
Cantu expressed great confidence
that he could defeat the federal
Troops with case. Five hundred men
enlisted yesterday and began training
last night under supervision of army
officers. It was announced that the
recruiting would continue until a
large force had been obtained. The
Chinese, some of whom are wealthy,
offered their tinancial help and ex
pressed their willingness to tight if
the Chinese ambassador at Washing
ton and the consul at Mexico City
would give their permission. Cantu
appointees are offering their money
and willingness to handle rifles.

cm NEED NOl
PAY ROYALTY ON
PAVING PATENT
1 If developed at the meeting of the
hoard of city commissioners held last
'night that, the patent on W'arrenite
paving has expired, and that in the
future it will not he necessary for the
city to pay a royalty upon it. This
fact was shown by Street Commission
er Pit/.er, who had obtained a copy of
the aWrrenite patent The city has
now takt-n up ttie question of paving
with the Willite people.
It is probable that the banks of the
city will buv the $l. r >,ooo bonds neces
sary to provide El Centro with a more
adequate fire alarm system. The
necessity of improvment in the (ire
alarm system is now a well established
fact, and as the banks are naturally
heavily interested in citv property it
is believed they will be very willing to
'finance the scheme.
Th'e bill of John Rice, for the sum
of $4.(540 for engineering work on the
New River project, was considered. It
is thought that Rice will offer a com
promise so that the matter will come
up before the board at the next meet
ing.
The hoard decided to award the El
Centro Progress the city printing, that
paper having presented the lowest bid
for a daily paper. The commissioners
came to the conclusion that the pub
lication of city printing in a daily
paper was an absolute necessity, and
the Progress bid. being the lowest,
was awarded the contract.
AROMA ARISING OUT
OF SLAUGHTER HOUSE
NOT ODOR, IS RULING
—•—
1 Holtville has again scored with r.
court case of peculiarity. This time
fthe case was won by the defendant
! when hq produced witnesses to suffi
j cient to prove that an odor is not an
| odor.
I Mrs. Ida Janies protested against
the conditions in the slaughterhouse
near her home in Holtville. She pro
duced several witnesses who stated
that the odor arising from the slaugh
ter house was very disturbing, that
at times sleepers were awakened >n
the middle of the night by the odor,
and that the slaughter house was op
erating in violation of the law, with
in less than a quarter of a mile from
j both a public highway and a canal.
' The defendants produced witnesses
who swore that the smell arising from
the slaughter house was not an odor,
but was regular part of the business.
Several of them stated that they had
j lived in the neighborhood of slaugh
i ter houses, or had worked in them, for
! many years, and that they had never
noticed the odor.
Although the case was technically
dismissed upon this plea the real
cause for dismissal arose from the
testimony of the director of the hoard
of health, who swore to the odor, and
to the uncleanliness of the place, and
stated that he had ordered the owners
to clean it up, but admitted that on
the strength of the testimony before
him he would no have sworn out a
complaint. It was this fact which
led the judge to decide in favor of the
defendants, in reality, although it is
a technical ruling that the smell aris
ing from a slaughter house is not an
odor.

Uroadway Is somewhat moie dlveml
fled at present.
Cinema manasuis, who teemed to
haio been otrtclcen with oldlllmltls
lor the. past seven days, yesterday
stepped out of the rut and are un
winding- n few novelties In thu tlltn
line.
Chaplin, in the long: press-agented
two-recler ""Pay Day,"" heads the
Hhort fe.ituio bill at the Strand while
Will KoRers presents ""A l'oor Re
lation"" at the Cap'.tol. The nivoll
Chimes In the ncw-lllm ehonis by
showing Pola XpriI In ""Tho Ited
Peacock"" nnd ""Slslois,"" a sobby af
fair. Is the lead-film nt the Camoo.
Murtnn Davles moved from tho Itivoll
to the mailt., taking ""Ueauty's

Mondial, the seir-liberator, is doing
both si fee n nnd personal appearance
duly in his latest thriller. ""The Alan
1'Yom l!o.onil.J"" at the Times Suuaio.
1'. may, nnd then again, tt may not
be. significant that one of the films
featured along with Pola Negri Is
""The Anvil Chorus."" The man we
sal next to must have been playing
tin; bats bazlntn ho didn't like tho
lllm at all and was afraid cverjonc in

""Orphans of the Slomi."" like the
much-talked t poor, !,eems 10 bo nl-
ways with us at Uio Apollo, where
business keeps up In spite of tho
lengthy run already enjoyed by tho
film. The ""tiovcs of Pharaoh"" keeps
right on going nt tho Criterion nnd
Harry Carey In tlie thrilling western
""Jinn to Man"" Is off to n good second
week nt tho Central.
c
PASSING IN REVIEW
Thoro are two distinct Charlie Chnp
llns, viz.: Chaplin tho clown and
Chaplin the nitlst. Both blend per
fectly In thn unicellng of the latest
Chaplin two-reel fe.ituic ""Pay Day,""
which heads thP film bill at the Strand
this week.
Add tho two Chaplin personalltlei
to the glorious stibject'of pay day and
j-ou could 'not ask a funnier or moro
pleasing bit of entertainment.
Chnrllo plays a bilcklayer. but what
an out-of-the-oidlnnry bricklayer he
makes of it. Charlie seems to have
forgotten much that ho should of Hit
old days and nt tho same time he has
remembered much that you an; glad
ho didn't forget.
""Pay Pas"" has been a Ions iim
coming, but It is worth the wait.
The balance of the Strand bill Is
fully up to the scieen ma ik and the
music is of tho Strand super-quality
llatr lloltdinl, In pcri-on, in the
picture. In spirit, In the lobby and in
the box office, started what Is hoped
to be an extended run at the Timei
Square Theatre, last night in his latest
thrill tlltn, ""The Man Prom Beyond.""
Tho Moo deals with a man, burled
m tho core of il alaeiei lot) yeais ago.
who romcs to life after :i t-Miturj of
cold storage ami wonders whut Us nil
about.
'Thcro are thrills,, then j couplo of
thrills nnd then moro thrills. Hou
dliil Is whirled to tho edgo of N'lagnm,
saves tho girl and
Hut ns thrilling ns Is thn lllm, Hon
dlnl's ""Thirty Minutes In nnd Out""
nut-thrills It. Always partial to Htury.
wo can truthfully say that"" his
""stunts,"" old nnd now, will hold any
audience spellbound for at least I'J of
the 30 minutes ho Is on tho stage.
Tho Capitol management advcitlses
"" typical Capitol i.ogrnmmo.""
Will Itogers In ""A Poor rtclatlotr
bonds thn bill and most of the rel Is
music.
""Sisters' is the feature cinema at
traction this week at U. S. Moss' cozy
Cameo Theatre on West 4Sm Street.
This story or repressed emotions Is
taken from the novel by Kathleen
N'orrls and directed 'by Albert Capcl
Innl. Seena Owen, Matt Mooro and
Olndys r.eslle. aro llip chief players.
""School Day Love,"" nn Kducatlonnl
Comedy with wlsp-crncklng kids,
trained animals and hokum Is a good
laugh provoker. Sardines, how they
are packed and shipped, Is an enter
taining bit of fish footage. The
Cameo News Kvetlts, a 'violin solo,
""I.e Deluge,"" Is rendered artistically
by Samson Noble, while Miss Uossle
Gerard takes care of the vocal enter
talnment with the rendition of ""fllnn
nlne .Mia.""
Pola Negri, in her latest starring
vehicle, ""Tho Hcd Peacock,"" at the
lllvoll. portrns tho experiences of a
girl of the slums who becomes u belle
of high society. Tho film Is an adap
tation from a play by John Krnly nnd
gives Mts Negri many opportunities
to dlsplav emotional acting, which she
makes the most of.

When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle displayed
to the Society of American
Magicians on Friday night a strip of
the film of the tyrannosaurs, tracho<Jons,
trieeratops, titanotheres, pelycosaurs,
cotylosaurs. brontosauruses.
stegosauruses, diplodocuses and other
me.sozolc and even earlier reptiles that
compose the cast of his movie, ""The
Lost World,"" he maneuvered himself
, Into an extremely likely lawsuit.
Herbert M. Dawley of Chatham,
K. J., declared last night that the trick
of making the prehistoric actors that
Sir Arthur employs in ""The Lost
World"" is his and that the United
States Patent Office has granted him
the sole right to manufacture the re
marKaDie creatures.
Moreover, Mr. Dawley said that the
patent he holds includes the materials
of which the beasts are made and the
methods of articulating the skeletons
and covering the bones with rubber
muscles.
""Someone Else to Blame.""
Mr. Dawley1 says that Sir Arthur Is
not to blame. He contended that he
i-an^show that a former employee of his
may be. responsible for the alleged infringement
knd that It Is wholly possible
that even the producer of Sir Arthur's
""The Lost World"" is an Innocent
party to a great mistake.
Mr. Dawley asserted that the process
of creating dinosaurs for the films cost
him much time and money. He said
that he spent at least a month In the
Academy of Natural History, where
Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn, the president.
and Frederic A. Lucas, the director,
gave him the freedom of the place
that he might study the bony structure
, of dinosaurs.
In his own laboratories in Chatham,
he made the tough flexible akin fabric
and worked out the firm rubber material
that goes to make the muscles of -the
great beasts. He declared that his
i j dinosaurla is made in miniature and so
photographed that the reptiles appear
on the screen in correct proportion in
order that the Illusion to the beholder
, might be complete. His first films were
shown at a convention of the New York
; j Zoological Society, said Mr. Dawley, and
: , the assembled scientists were honestly
enthusiastic.
T?~ . ilrMilrflnt.
.
' Mr. Dawley asserted that he will con1
suit his lawyers at once and take such
steps as they may acem advisable. He
added:
""1 am loth to embarrass Sir Arthur
because I am quite certain that he is
utterly innocent. However. I have my
cwn patents to protect. I have two sucn
... pictures on exhibition now. One of them
if' is 'The Ghost of Clumber Mountain' and
' the other 'Along the Moonbeam Trail.'
,,|'i i Both were produced In Chatham. Sir
>'! Arthur's dim was made out in Cali j
fornia.""
, , An effort to impart the news to Sir
(j Arthur failed. His secretary said that
he could say nothing about it. and that
| the whole matter was in the hands of
the producer. Just who the producer is
. |, could not be learned certainly, although
Sir Arthur. In a letter to Harry Houdinl,
president of the Society of American
. ' Magicians, declared tnat It wak due to
"" ; the courtesy of Watterson Rothakcr that
he was able to show the assembled
miracle workers his leaping, fighting,
T ( courting and canaballatlc dinosauria.

J v 588 Fifth Avenue,
The probability that Sir Arthur will
become involved In a legal tangle and ||
that ""The Lost World"" be numbed by fl
an Injunction la made more probable
owing to the fact that some time ago
Mr. Dawley made an effort to stop the
making of the British spiritualist's rep- i
tiles. He said:
""I was under the impression that |
| mere w?,s a clear unuurvianuiuji ouum j
I all this and that my patent rights were
to be respected. However. I am compelled
to think that I was in error in
so thinking. Naturally I shall ask my
lawyers to take such measures that
will end the controversy at once. There
's no d^ubt about the situation. The
patent Is mine. I have not been consulted
about the making of Sir Ar- I
thur's dinosauria.""
All Fan to Sir ArtUiir. '
That. Sir Arthur had no Inkling of the ;
Impending legal proceedings Is indicated j
ho makes no reference to the subject
of the Secret process hy which the""
dinosaurs arfe made. It read:
""My cinema interlude upon the occasion
of the magicians' dinner should, 1
think, be explained now that its purpose
was fulfilled. The purbosh was.
simply to provide a little mystification
to those who have so often and so successfully
mystified others.
""In presenting my moving dinosaurs
1 I had to walk very warily in my speech
! so as to preserve the clamor and yet say
: nothing which I could not Justify as llt:
erally true. But I was emphatic that it
| was not occult and only psychic insofar
as all things human come from a man's
spirit
""It was prenatural in the sense that
It was not nature as we know It. All
my other utterance"", were, as I think
you will agree, within the actual f^cts. >,
""The dinosaurs and other monsters
have been constructed by pure cinema,
but of the highest kind, and are being I
used for 'The Lost World' picture, which I
represents prehistoric life upon a South I
American plateau. Having sftch mate- I
rial at hand and being allowed by the I
courtesy of Mr. Watterson Rothaker to I
use Jt. I could not resist the temptation I
to surprise your associates and guests. I
I am sure they will forgive me if for a I
few short hours I had them guessing. j
""And now, Mr. Chairman, confidence I
begets confidence and I want to know I
how you ,got out of that trunk."" I

“Airways, ” Inc. Is Best Play
Produced by New Playwrights
JOHN DOS PASSOS’ “Airways,] ii
“ Inc.,” now bainpf presented a. the J
Grove Street Theatre, is the best t
play the New Playwrights Theatre b
he s produced.
It is clear, it is direct, it moves f
with a life of its own. and for- <1
tunately, very fortunately, its nu- h
thor doesn’t try to lift himself by b
his proletarian bootstraps. John p
Dos Passos is one of those few in- ii
tellectuals who managed to salvage o
his brains after the general debacle ! t
of the American bourgeois intu'lec- g
tuals when they discovered with b
tears in their voices that there ain’t; a
no Santy Claus; or in other words, t
that the iate Woodrow Wilson’s ; I
“democracy” palaver was so much i t
hooey. Dos Passos has gone left in 1
the last few years and is close to j J
the Communist movement. And
unlike hi 3 Broadway colleagues ' t
from Eugene O’Neill down to the 0
most picayune hack, he doesn’t j
write as if the world consisted only ]
of certain individuals and the j s
friends and relatives of certain in-! •
dividuals. Dos Passos knows that
capitalist society is a fact and the j T
class struggle is a fact, and facts i i
such asrthese thrust their way im- g
placably into the most sheltered t
lives. t
“Airways, Ine.,” is not a play j
of the class struggle. It is a play j
of personal frustration and tragedy „
against the background of the class 1
struggle. It attempts to interre-1
late social conflicts with individual |
conflicts, but only partly succeeds. „
The social conflict in the play, rep
resented by a mill strike, is actually j.
rather shadowy, too off-stage. As
chief protagonists we have the
members of a suburban working j
class family who reflect completely j ‘
the bourgeois ideology of the typi- j
cal American working class fr.m-!
ily. What happens to these peo- j 1
pie, these petty-bourgeois Turners , 1
when a long drawn-out mill strike | t
shatters the equilibrium of their ■ ■
little tight lives? John Dos Passos *
tries to tell us. But he doesn’t sue- «■
ceed. W’hat he actually tells us is |
what happens to these people when ,
an individual named Walter Gold- c
berg, who happens to be a strike- \ c
leader and a Jew, steps into their ]
lives by falling in love with the <
starved, somewhat elderly sister, .
Martha Turner. And the execution
of Goldberg on a framed murder
charge (echoes of the Sacco-Van
zetti case) is presented not as so
cial tragedy—the anger, the bitter
ness, the grief of the workers—but j
as personal tragedy, the personal 1 1
grief of Martha Turner over the ■
loss of her lover.
These are the weaknesses of ;
“Airways, Inc.,” as social drama. ,
Its strength, however, lies not in '
its presentation of its them or
themes (the play is rich, perhaps a ;
little too rich in thematic material), _
but in the mordant accuracy of its
character delineation and its satir
ical revelation of certain aspects of
American life. All these charac-, (
ters are real —the doting old fath
er, brooding over his inventions, his
loneliness, the disappointments of
the past; the gawky, starved, semi
hysterical Cinderella of the fam
ily, Martha Turner, bewildered and
abashed by the experience of love;
the S3O a week clerk, Claude Tur
ner, who outdoes any capitalist in
his fierce hatred of strikers and
“Reds”; Elmer, the smiling self
confident son who has “made i
good”; the blustering realtor, Jona
than Davis; the kid brother, Eddie,
and his flapper sweetheart, Edna —
all of them are flesh and blood.
Even the mystical, half-mad pro
fessor has a reality of his own. And
over the Turner household hangs
the pall, the meaninglessness, the
festering decay of petty-bourgeois
life.
But all this is not nearly as mov-1
ing as it should be. What “Air
ways, Inc.,” lacks is incisiveness. I
think this is due to the attempt to
knit together several themes, none
of which is completely worked out.
The play ends feebly, almost ab
surdly with a lyrical peroration by
Martha Turner in grief over the
execution of her lover. And all
that Walter Goldberg stood, for?
And her own future place in so
ciety? Only a short while before
we have been told that the dividends
from All-American Airways, Inc.,
have made them all rich. So Mar
tha, grieving Martha, is now a
member of the leisure class. If this

is irony, then it fails to come off. I
And the soliloquy itself—really, it’s ■
too literary, too O’Neillish. Good
by itself, but not in the play.
“Airways, 1r.c.,” has the good
fortune to be unusually well pro
duced and acted. The chief acting
honors are simply run away with
by a young lady who seems to have
popped in from nowhere. Her name
is Mary Hall and she plays*the part
of Edna, the flapper, so pungently
that she almost makes all the other
good acting around her seem flat
by comparison. Excellent work is
also done by Harry Gordon as Wal
ter Weinberg, Edmund Fordc as
Dad Turner, Edith Meiser as Mar
tha Turner, Charles Kraus as the
Professor and M. Tello Webb as
Jonathan Davis.
“Airways, Inc.,” is hardly revolu
tionary drama. There is in it more
of resignation than protest. Nor
does it seek to titillate pseudo-revo- i
lutionary sensibilities by irrelevant J
singing of the International or wav
ing of red flags. But there is the
beat of life in it, and it has been
written, unlike certain other New ,
Playwrights offspring, with intelli- .
gence, clarity and disciplined emo-!;
tion. It is a vital contribution to ,
the American drama.

Cameo Today
The technique of the cinema
which we have come to characterize
as Teutonic can be viewed in “That ,
Murder in Berlin,” which will be ’
shown a; the Cameo Theatre for its j
American premiere presentation.
A sparing use of sub-titles will be
one of the peculiarities noticed and j !
that is typical of their method of j !
; motion-picture production abroad,
where action is never minimized. ;!
Every technical trick that does away
with wording is resorted to; even j
a new- device is introduced—a sort
jof double exposure which permits j
| the audience to see two scenes at ;
' once.
Magda Sonja has the part of the
| accused in “That Murder in Berlin,”
which is filmed from a story by
Max Brod and directed by Frederick ;
Feber. Other continental players,
well known abroad include Carl
Gotz. Anton Pointner, Gustav Die

The Nightmare Voyage —A-
- That Never Came Back
(By a Seatnan Correspondent)
Everything or. deck was topsy
turvy—loose cement, broken bar
rels, rubbish, dunnage—lying all
about. Under the “break of the
poop” a miserably small pile of
ship-stores, consisting of a half a
dozen sacks cf potatoes, a few bar
rels of salt junk (beef) and several
cases of rope “yarns” (canned mut
ton) were gazing into our faces as
if to say: Hunger!
The first mate, a large, raw
boned man with a wrinkled face of
solemn and melancholy expression,
came down the poop and speaking
to us in a gruff voice he checked
our rames. We were told to go
“for’ard.” A low, square, box-like
structure, at the foot of the fore
mast, was the forecastle. It had
one broken door and six small port
holes, a damp, dark and dingy place
of low ceiling and bare, cold iron
sides.
An old. rusty hurricane lamp with
a cracked globe was suspended from
the ceiling. Along the wet, iron
sides were sixteen filthy, evil-smell
j ing, bedbug-ridden bunks in double
j rows. Chilly, damp and miserable
j weather outside—stink, filth and
dripping water inside, “castie of
steel,” castle of death. . . .
After a short consultation we all
marched “aft” in a body to demand
a stove. A weasel of a man, the
flunkey with a sprouting red beard,
resembling a rat looking through a
pile of oakum, met us at the en
| trance of the master’s cabin. Try
ing to bar our way, he told us to
wait outside. Brushing him aside
wc all walked into the cabin.
What a contrast! Oriental rugs
and carpets, polished oak panels
with fancy carving, mahogany desk,
tables and soft casy-chairs; shining
I brass railings and large swinging
lamps of vari-colored shades; open,
old-fa shioned fire-place—crackling,
dancing flames—cheerful warmth,
ease, comfort, luxury!
The captain, a middle-aged man
! with coarse, gray hair—unkempt,
unshaved drunkard of red lobster
like face and a big strawberry nose,
came from the after cabin and,
shouting to us in a hoarse, rough
voice, demanded to know: “What in
hell do you want in here?”
“We want a stove in the fore
castle—no stove, no work,” in a
clear, strong voice, replied oui
j spokesman.
The “almighty” master looked up
as if to say something, but on see-

ing a strong, compact and deter- _
mined body of men, he Boon calmed
down, and, taking to open diplo
macy, he began to argue.
“Well, boys,” he said in a low,
whining voice, “my owners have
spent too much money on fitting
out this ship, and I don’t think they
can afford to get a stove; besides
in the 34 years there never has been
a stove in the ‘fo’c’s’le,’ but I will
try to see what I can do for you,
‘my boys.’ ”
“Yes, ‘cap,’ you better try, for
there will be no work done until we
get the stove,” replied our spokes
man.
The stove was sent aboard the
same afternoon, and also a well-fed,
rosy-cheeked, smiling parson— “sky
pilot.” Along with the stove and
the parson came along a big pack
age of bibles, prayer books, church
leaflets and all kinds of paper—the
mental fuel, religious dope.
He left, and, needless to say, we j
soon had a good fire in the fore
castle; the stovepipe was red hot.
roaring flames shot heavenward, i
! Standing or sitting around the
fiercely burning stove, we all made

Black Haiti 1—
..... „ ,
Through a friend, an Englishman named George Hey, the author
gets a job at the Electric Light Company in Port au Prince, Haiti, at
a salary of $25 a month. Dixon, a white colonist straw-boss whom
Dicharson has taken into his confidence, betrays him, and after way
laying him to the Terminus Ear, knocks him unconscious with a gun.
Dicharson makes his way to the home of his friend, and Hey and his
native girl, Pauline, nurse him.
Dicharson tries to obtain redress, but fails. He becomes very
ill with malaria. He is taken to the hospital where he together with
the wretched natives who are lying there are mistreated and starved.
When he finally gets strong enough to drag himself out, he goes to
Hcy’s house and finds that the latter has had a bad fall.
• * *
By JACQUES DICHARSON.
J WENT down to the Gi-ande Rue to Deriex’s. Deriex’s is one of the
1 swell restaurants in Port au Prince, owned and managed by a French
colonist. It is rumored that he had been “vacationing” in the Guineas
before coming to Haiti.
I took a piece of paper, borrowed a pencil and wrote George a
note. I told him how sorry I was that he was in the hospital. I told
him that I had come out that morning and was ashamed but could not
go and see him. I had suffered so much in that dreaded place, that the
mere thought of having to enter it once more would set me crazy. I
finished by telling him that I would start for Santo Domingo that
same day, and that I would never fail to write him.
* * *
J HAD forty cents as I left Hcsco’s behind me in the blistering sun.
1 I figured on taking the road thru the Nordby, St. Marc, Gonaives.
and Cap-Haitian. That road is more frequented and perhaps I would
obtain a job in one of the towns. That would give me enough money
+ o continue my journey, into the land of Gomez.
That afternoon the natives forming a continuous stream going ar.d
coming on the trail grinned friendly ar.d astonishingly at me. They
were the peasants. The back-bone of Haiti. They are far from having
the same mental attitude as the city people. They are not influenced
by Wall Street’s persuasive civilization. Most of them are children at
heart.
That night I slept under the stars. A faint murmur would come
to me. I loved the sound. The tom-toms. ... It helped close my
tired eyes that night.
I would have slept well if it had not been for the mosquitoes. It
seemed to me that I had been persecuted all my life by them—Miniature
bombers they were.
Next morning the sun’s piercing rays awakened me. I got up and
resumed my march toward Utopia, or would it turn out to be another
Hades? Quien sabe. . . .
V * •
FIVE days later I bought some salt herrings and a few biscuits from
a young girl mounted on a bourrique, the Haitian she-ass. She had
just come from town and had caught up with me. I kept time with her
a little while. Her bourrique was walking.
I remember her vividly as I sit now. Remember her with her
scale, headgear. A big red handkerchief, striped with blue, jauntly
posed on one side of her head. She was pretty. Her bosom heaved,
as she' related to me the recent quarrel she had had with her petit
chatt! . . . She thrilled me as she told me her undying love for him.
Love. . . . What was Love. ... It was not for me or my kind. . . .
I had no room for it in my life; it was not mine anyway, it seemed.
It belonged to :~>y masters.
I envied her as she left me a little later. Envied her, for her ap
parent contentment in life.
While I had been thinking I had captured a few more of those
elusive kilometers. I was nearing St. Marc.
A little later I entered the town. I created a sensation. Every
one was looking at me. They were staring as if they had never seen a
white man before. No, I don’t think they had, that is i n my present
condition. I have dark brown hair, but by a bizzare whim of nature
have a blondish red sort of beard when I allow it to grow So you
see the picture I must have offered as I tottered in thru the main
street. Dirty with five days dirt on me, my old Khaki pants dytog from
premature old age. Whiskers, native hat, ragged blue shirt. All that
J needed was an ass. Then they would have thought that I was the com
ing of the second christ.
* * *
I PASSED thru the whole town and on the other side got some water
from a friendly native and washed up. I spent the last of my forty
cents for five herrings and ten biscuits. With that provision I would
reach Gonaives.
Three days later found me there. I had not fared badly, I had
shared nattes with the natives, and gladly accepted their bread-fruit
and yams.
Before I came into town I had shaved at a peasant’s hut with a
piece of broken bottle that he venerably kept there for that purpose.
His wife had kindly washed my trousers and patched them up the best
way she could.
• * »
I DIRECTLY went into one of the biggest stores and asked the owner,
1 a Monsieur Lenoir, for a job. He gave me one at the salary of S3O
a month. I had to be some sort of a handy man in the office, typing,
making out prices on invoices, and keeping books. He advanced me a
few dollars so that I could look half way decent.
I was stopping at the Sea-View Hotel. The proprietor, a Haitian
bourgeois, was not a bad fellow. As long is I paid him regularly he
never said anything, he agreed to everything I said. Except on one
occasion. It was on a Saturday night. I had to pay the tailor that
night, so I told him that I would not be able to settle my hill until next
Tuesday. . . . Tableau!. . . We had an argument. In the midst of
it he called me a dirty bolshevik. I can’t understand or never could
how people will miscomprehend and misapply that word. Bolshevik
... one should be proud to he that. . . .

STRIKE OUT OF
FAKERS’ BLUFF
Left Wing- in Huge
Meeting
(Continued from Page Or.-.)
clique will receive a serious set
! back in the next few days.
The Cooper Union meeting was
held at the exact time that I L. G.
W. officials, cloak manufacturers
and leading Tammany politicians
were meeting with Gov. Roosevelt in
; Albany on the pretense that they
were working out plans to “arbi
trate” the fakq stoppage.
With the announcement after the
conference that “negotiations” be
tween the bosses and the company
union will be resumed on Wednes
day, it became increasingly clear
that a new “Governor’s Commis
sion,” similar to the one of 1925,
now hangs over the heads of the
cloakmakers. A bitter 19 weeks’
strike followed the decisions of that
commission which ordered given to
the bosses concessions for which the
workers had fought for years.
Lieut. Gov. Herbert H. Lehman,
v ho was chairman of the 1925 com
mission, and Raymond V. Ingersoll,
325,000-a-year “impartial chair
man” of the industry, will join in
the so-called negotiations which will
begin Wednesday.
These “negotiations” are expected
to be similar to the shadow-boxing
stage play engaged in between the
1 manufacturers and the company
j for many weeks prior to the stop
! page.
Sasha Zimmerman, one of the
leaders of the Industrial Union,
i acted as chairman of the meeting,
; which was addressed by Loui3 Hy
! man, Ben Gold and Joseph Boru
chowitz.
Zimmerman pointed out that on
| the first day of the fake stoppage,
the company union chiefs were un--
able to gather together more than
two miserable meetings. While the
thousands of cloakmakers were
meeting in Cooper Union, Zimmer
man said, the clique was calling
their mythical “28,000 strikers” to
two meetings, one in Brownsville
Labor Lyceum and the other in As
toria Hall. The latter place, the
speaker said, was reported practical
ly empty.
Reckoned Without Workers.
All the speakers bared in detail
the fake stoppage, and declared that
its main purpose was to squeeze
more thousands out of the cloak
| makers.
The bosses and their agents reck
ons! without the workers, they said,
and this was revealed by the empti
i ness of the I. L. G. W. halls on the
one hand, and the enthusiastic mass
demonstration of th£Y Industrial
Union in Cooper Union, on the other
hand.
The speakers also told .the woi'k
ers not to be terrorized by the gang
! sters and pickpockets in the hire of
the company union. In every case
where the workers show resistance,
these worthies make themselves
scarce, they said.
Great Enthusiasm.
The Cooper Union meeting was
remarkable both in attendance and
enthusiasm despite the attempts of
the Schlesinger-Dubinsky gangsters
to interfere with workers on their
way to the hall. Just before the
meeting began, a score of these
strong-arms attempted to invade
the hall, but the workers gave these
worthies an impressive fare-you
well, and the I. L. G. W. thugs re
luctantly left. They later gathered
around Eighth St., between Second
and Third Aves., where they tried
to attack workers as they made their
way to the hall. As a result a group
of the gorillas and several workers
were arrested.
It Is the ultimate aim of this
work (“Capital”) to reveal the
economic law of motion of modern
society.—Marx.

200 New Members Back
War on Rent Hogs
i ..
The Harlem Tenants’ League’s
Executive Board met last night to
consider the hundreds of cases of
tenants who have joined or became
reactive following the expiration of
■ the State Emergency Rent Laws on
' June 1.
1 At the last meeting over 70 cases I
of rent boosts were reported by !
new members. The tenants are . he- j
’ tween two choices, pay rent in- j
1 creases or organize; therefore the
[ Executive Board voted to . make ■
: special preparations to take care of
| the* 200 cases now dumped into the
' League's overcrowded office. Cler
i ical aids are unable to carry on
the work efficiently because of the :
: volume of work.
In order to arrange for the next
■ i regular meeting, Monday, July 8, in
! the 135th St. Library, the League L
■ will bo forced to keep working 24 i
hours a day during Saturday and
• Sunday.
, In a statement last night, Solo
mon Harper, publicity director,
stated: .“Only members of the Com
i munist Party and left wing trade
[ unions have given full co-operation
1 to keep the tenants of Harlem from
complete enslavement by greedy j
• landlords. Many of the tenants are !
treated worse than they were on the i
’ lynch dumps of the South and in j
the Latin-American countries dom- !
, inated by Yankee imperialism. The
: League invites representatives of all
working class organizations to help
the Tenants’ League in its fight for
i the workers' of this city, all being
affected by the same system as that
which is slowly crushing the work
i ers in Harlem. Nothing short of
' breaking up the system will save
1 the workers.”

Collect Funds for
Mine and Needle
Strikers in N. Y.
The Workers International Relief
of New York has planned a mass
collection on Dec. 21 and 22 for the
miners and needle trades strikers.
“The employers are driving full
speed ahead attempting to smash
the ranks of the workers,” says the
statement issued by the N. Y.
branch of the W. I. R. “There is
only one course for the working
class, the strongest resistance
against this new offensive, the
united forces of the workers for
solidarity.”
Collection boxes are now ready.
Call or phone for the amount you
will use. The office of the N. Y.
Workers International Relief is 799
Broadway.
Shoe Pickets Stand Up
to Cop Who’d Shoot
(Continued from Page One)
all there had been on strike from six
to ten weeks.
The jailed workers passed a reso
lution to fight the battle to a vic
tory, pointing out the united front
of the bosses, the A.F.L. and the
department of labor all trying to
break the strike, and only the soli
darity of the workers to defend it.
All were released without bail, but
two. These are Max Hein, charged
with assault, haii S2OO, and George
Spyranious, no one present to make
a charge, but held in S3OO bail, after
having been followed around from
his home to a restaurant, to union
headquarters, and quizzed by detec
tives. He is held on S3OO bail. Trial
date for all 38 is set for Dec. 19.
Trick Fails.
Some employers spies yesterday
tried to call a meeting of strikers,
presumably to oppose the strike.
They had handbills signed simply,
“Committee,” printed in English and
Italian, saying this strike is ""ill

The U. M. W. A. is so much wor- j
ried by the mass movement of the i
! miners that it is afraid to start ex- j
pulsions. It has adopted the curious :
policy of fining all of its members
j who join the N. M. U. The amount ;
of the fine levied, hut not paid by
miners, is $25.
The miners absolutely reject the ‘
loudly advertised U. M. W. A. but- j
ton. The Lewis gang does not have |
the check-off here, and tries to force j
j the miners to pay their U. M. W. A. j
dues, and get in exchange a big |

, “Must Give Relief to
Striking Illinois
Miners” WIR
The Workers International Relief
i is launching a nation-wide campaign
to furnish relief for the striking ll
| linois miners. It announces that spe.
cial headquarters are being estab
i lished in Chicago and relief stations
will be opened in the strike field as
! soon as possible.
“The calling out of the National
; Guard,” says the W.I.R. “on the
; first day of the strike of the Illinois
j miners shows that the bosses are
wasting no time in mobilizing all
their forces to crush the fight of
j the brutally exploited coal diggers.
“The fight of the Illinois miners
, is the fight of every worker, every
enemy of capitalism. Against them
are united ail the reactionary forces
: that the bosses can command—state
j troops, police, thugs, and the strike
breaking company union agents of
■ the Lewis and Fishwick machines in
the United Mine Workers. The six-
I hour day and five-day week, increase
! in wages, abolition of the speed-up
‘ and the infamous checkoff system—
] these are the chief demands of the
miners who are fighting under the
1 leadership of the militant National
Miners Union.”
“We must have the support of
every worker, every workers’ or
ganization. Send contributions of
money and food at once to the Na
tional Office of the W.1.R., 949 !

The Haitian Corporation of Amer

Co., the Haitian Pineapple Co., the !
Banque Nationale de la Republique ’
d’Haiti, supported by gunmen and
trained murderers wearing the uni
form of the U. S. Marine Corps. j
These same banking and indus

workers in the United States. Y’our j
boss is either an investor or is in
partnership in some form or other
with the big banking institutions
which are robbing both us and the
Haitian masses through starvation j
wages, long hours, speed-up, etc.
The fight of the Haitian workers
and peasants is therefore our fight.

| While these attacks on the Hai

j States, British, French and Italian
| navies are bombing the Chinese |
; masses in order to suppress their re- 1
ivolt against the Nanking butchers.!
In India, Palestine, Africa, and |
throughout the world similar at- j
tacks on the colonial masses are j
being made by the imperialist op-j
pressors. Only the Socialist Father
land of the world’s workers, the
Union of Socialist Soviet Republics,
has not only liberated the peoples;
formerly under the heel of the mon- j
archists and Russian and foreign!
i capitalists, but is today the friend f
and leader of the workers of the |
| colonial countries and of the world, j
I It is exactly for this reason that the
| capitalists and their pacifist and
“socialist” allies have directed such
fierce attacks on the fatherland of ]
the world’s workers, the Soviet ;
Union,
The brutal terror used against the
colonial masses is also used against
striking workers in the United
States. Witness the events in Gas
tonia, Chicago, New Orleans and the
brutality of the police in New York.
In the United States, the Commu
nist Party fights for the Haitian
masses and in defense of the work
i ers of the United States. This
fight must also be against the paci
-1 fists and “socialists” who have al
j lied themselves with W'all Street
and Washington in their attacks on
! militant workers’ organizations, in
sending workers to jail; in framing
them on trumped up charges, in
smashing workers’ headquarters and
deporting the foreign born, and in
to the terribIeDHARSDOILNUNU
persecuting Negro workers in the
U. S. as well as in Haiti for daring
to raise their voice in protest to
the terrible conditions imposed upon
them.
This Saturday at 1:15 p. m. work

in demonstration against these con

FEKS—The Eccentric in
the Soviet Union Cinema
| “Our cinema has reached such a
high degree of development that ;
we already have a group of film I
! artists who have a right to be
I wrong.” This is one of the argu- 1
ments of the “affirmative” in the
stirring debate now taking place in
: the Soviet cinema press and in the
| artistic and intellectual circles in
! and outside the film industry. The
! debate revolves about a group of
! film iconoclasts calling themselves
Fcks, an abbreviated term that
! stands for “Studio of the Eccentric”
j or else “Studio of the Expei'imental
‘ Actor.”
The right of the Feks to be wrong
|is now generally conceded, but it
took four years of raging contro- j
versy, of earnest work and of start
; ling achievement for the Feks to
establish their light to be wrong.
At that they may not be wrong at
all. As the Soviet public is grow
ing accustomed to the Feks films 1
(five of them have been produced i
to date), the “eccentricities” no
| longer appear as shocking, and the j
| new treatment- of screen material
I finds more and more admirers. In- j
1 deed, many of the orthodox critics
| who came to scoof, remained to
j praise. While the last production
i of the Feks, “New Babylon,” which
is now showing at the Cameo The
atre, brought about a lively cross
fire of controversy, it won the sig
nal distinction of being placed by
the official Film Repertory Com
mission in the “first category” of
the Soviet cinema products, i. e., in

The convention, which is expected
to end today, has been almost as
long already as a special session of
congress. It was packed in the be
ginning, being made up of the offi
cials and their gangsters, and is a |
rubber stamp for the employers. I
Its principal other actions, besides 1
authorizing a fake strike for Jan
uary 1, were to vote heavy assess

locals charge more dues, and vote
to lobby for expulsion of Philippine
garments, to help the American
bosses.

Militant picketing was resumed
yesterday by the Needle Trades In
dustrial Union before all struck
shops. A considerable number of
bosses who relied on the Interna
tional Ladies’ Garment Workers’
fake “strike,” which was supposed
to be contemplated for the frst of
the year to fool all the workers and
establish a company union, are find
j ing out their mistake. The workers
| are doing some real striking, and
| pushing through their organization
j campaign with vigor.
The union yesterday called on all
j active members to come up to its
office at once to be assigned to
organization work.
Today, in Bryant Hall, Sixth Ave.
1 and 42nd St., at 1 p. m., Paul
Yudich, labor editor of the Freiheit,

; the same class with “Potemkin,”
| “Ten Days That Shook the World”
and “The End of St. Petersburg.”
The Feks comprise a group of re
bellious modernists who chose the
I screen as their new stamping
[ grounds. They are the direct de
scendants of the rebels who a de
| cade or so ago rose against the
traditional method of the Russian
theatre. As innovators and icono
clasts they belong in the same camp
with the great leader of the the
-1 atrical rebellion, Vsevolod Meier
[ hold. Like the Futurists of a gen
! oration ago they were at first con
i cerned principally with the task of
1 shocking and scandalizing the man
darins of established tradition. In
this they thoroughly succeeded.
Their first production was a film
named ‘The Adventures of Comrade
Octobrina,’ a preposterous farce
poking fun at the housing conditions
:in Leningrad. Its manner was more
“eccentric” than its matter. With
impish disregard for the “rules of
the game” the Feks heaped all kinds
of incongruities into this film,
which by its general tenor re
sembled an American “comic” more
than a piece of artistic ultra-mod
ernism. The Feks obviously had a
“good time” with this picture, like
mischievous truants on a spree.

In another way their irreverence
before tradition was exhibited in
; the treatment of a well-known stor;.
by the immortal Gogol. The tcx.
was turned topsy-turvy by the
scenarion writer, and the orthodc
intellectuals who considered Gogoi
a national shrine, were thoroughly
outraged at the manner in which
the pathetic story of the govern
ment clerk who was robbed of his
new great coat was treated. One on
.he ardent defenders of the good
dd traditions in literature proposed
n dead earnest, that the Feks b e
Igced on trial as common felons,
tie urged thus: Gogol’s writings are
Jie property of the Soviet Republic;
; the Feks wilfully and maliciously
i mutilated a literary relic, the prop
| erty of the Republic; ergo, they arc
| felons and must stand trial as such.
But, as the Feks went on with
their “eccentricities” they lost a
good deal of their ardor for icono
clasm, and gained much wisdom by
way of positive style and manner.
Dropping their rogueries they be
came true experimenters in the
cinema. The Soviet Government,
with its fine broadmindedness to
ward every school and departure in
the realm of art, did not deny the
Feks its financial support, and they
were allowed to continue with their
experimentation under a constant
barrage of criticism, abuse and in
vective. And now the Feks brought
out “New Babylon,” a film officially
pronounced of the “first category.”
The moving spirits of the Feks are

Inventions of
Shot) Workers
THE steady increase in the number
* of inventions by workers in the
Soviet Union is a smashing blow at
all the parasites and lackeys who
argue that Socialism destroys all
initiative. Many workers still be
lieve that the boss class is neces
sary because they supply the brains
~ and keep the wheels of industry
i going. But the building of social
v ism in the Soviet Union-by the ef
' forts of the workers themselves
knocks the bottom out of this propa
ganda of the bosses.
In this country, it is useless for
the worker to invent anything, be
cause he is either tricked out of it
by the big corporations, or he hasn’t
the money to develop the invention
that he has made. And when it is
developed, it only serves to increase
the exploitation of the working
class and the profits of the bosses.
In addition, there are not enough j
markets to absorb all that the capi- j
talist-owned machinery can produce
today—that is, with a profit to the
capitalists, so that instead of allow
ing the forces of production to de
• velop to their fullest extent, capi
f- talism now strongly tends to limit
'{ and hinder their development.
In the Soviet Union, on the other i
hand, where the workers run the in
dustries for their own benefit and
not for the benefit of a class of j
parasites, the revolution ""has re
leased a vast creative energy with
■ in the widest sections of the work
ing class. Inventions and the de
velopment of the productive forces
are encouraged and stimulated.
As a matter of fact, inventions by !
workers on the job in Soviet fac
tories have become 5 o numerous
that in some factories almost every
worker is busy Workirg out some I
new process oa tool. The Briansk [
Locomotive factory, “Krasnye Prof
intern” offers or.e of the most strik
ing examples. During 1928, the
workers of this factory submitted
over a thousand inventions, and
those that were accepted saved the j
plant ;J28,000 rubles in operating
economies. “Not a single process |
of production, not a single detail of I
the works escaped the eager atten
tion of the worker inventors,” ac-;
cording to a report in the May issue
of the “Soviet Union Review.”
“During last October alone four
hundred proposals were submitted I
to the administration by the work-1
•a ers. So great is the flood of in-
J ventions by the workers in this sac-
tory that the department to which
the inventions are referred could
not ban lie all of them, and three
special commissions had to be or
ganized to consider the different
types of inventions, and also a spe
cial bureau to examine new pro
posals. Os the 13,000 workers in
this factory, 600 have become in-;
ventors. ... A system of prem
iums for inventions has been estab
lished and during the past year j
30,000 rubles have been paid out to
workers in the form of premiums.”'
The “Press” factory in Moscow
which makes different kinds of tin
ware, is another example. Here,
tens of thousands of rubles have
been saved by the workers’ inven
tions and the whole process of pro
duction has been entirely reorgan
ized. As a result, many processes
formerly done by hand are now |
done automatically by machinery. 1
One worker’s invention of a method
of automatic lubrication increased
the output of one press from 12,000 ,
to 20,000 articles a day. Auto
matic methods of cutting and stamp- i
ing invented by a worker increased
the output of another machine from I
25,000 to 30,000.
These two factories, we are told
in the report, are no exception. “The
Five-Year Plan and the competition
between the different factories and
different sections within a factory,
has given a tremendous impetus to
creative activity among the work
ers, which is being supported in
every way by the factory adminis
trations and the government.” I
LABOR SPORTS I
Baseball.
THE Washington Senators are con
* tinuing to hold their lead in the
American League, with the Philly
Athletics right on their trail. As
both leagues are getting further in
to the season the race for the pen
nant is constantly narrowing down.
Both of the New York teams are in
the fourth place, which is unusual
for them. The baseball world would
receive a shock of their lives if one
of the New York teams did not fin
ish first. However, such is a pos
sibility.
* * *
An innovation is being tried out
In professional baseball through
which the owners hope to increase
their shekels through the turnstiles.
As it is at present it is difficult for
them to reach those workers that
have jobs, since baseball is being
played in the afternoon. The minor
leagues are being used to experiment
with night baseball, using flood
lights. If this proves successful the
major league owners will introduce
the system in the league. This night
bweball will enable them to draw
more workers to see the games.

Another Case Where Liars
Do Figure: 1930 Year Book
Rand School Avoids Mention of Most Workers’
Struggles; Boosts I. L. G. W. and Muste
By VERN SMITH.
THE AMERICAN LABOR YEAR
BOOK, 1930. Published by Rand
School of Social Science, New
York. 448 Pages. Price $3.15.
* * *
THE RAND SCHOOL’S “Ameri
can Labor Year Book” has, since
1916, the year of its origin, provided
in handy and condensed form much
valuable material: facts, dates, tab
les, names of organizations and per
sons and history of events connected
with the class struggle. Through
much of this period it provided facts
(n the less obviously political field)
with a fair degree of accuracy, and
with a certain objectiveness, due ap
parently to weak central control by
the socialist party over those who
actually did the work on the year
book.
The issue of 1930 (covering the
period of year 1929) is still valu
able, in the sense that government
reports, even of a capitalistic, even
of a fascist government, are valu
able to workers. You know they
lie, that they lie especially by the
subtle means of emphasis, conceal
ment of certain things, and report
ing of others of less general import
ance, but you take it fairly safely
for granted that whatever they qd
mit to their own discredit, is at least
that bad, and no one knows how
much worse.
Thus when this year’s American
Labor Year Book says in its Inter
national Labor Diary: “July 1 —
Elections in Finland: Socialists ob
tained 59 seats (60 formerly); Com
munists secured 23 formerly 20)”
you can take that as an admission
of fact.
But due to growing fascisation of
the socialist party, and more aware
ness of the leaders of their special
mission of saving capitalism in
America, due probably to less hamp
ering from real workers who drop
put of the party in larger and larger
numbers, and give way to labor
bureaucrats and petty bourgeois,
the Year Book of 1930 is shot thru
and permeated with socialist party
propaganda and anti-Communist
propaganda, rather more than you
will find in any capitalist govern
ment publication. Evidently a new
personnel is in charge of the book.
For example, the U. S. depart
ment of labor will admit there was
a great miners’ strike led by the Na
tional Miners Union in Illinois last
December; but the American Labor
Year Book does not list this small
matter in its “International Labor
Diary”. Moreover, under the article,
“Miners” over on page 77, you find
a page and a half of apologyy for
the Fishwick machine, and six lines
on page 79 about the National Min
ers Union.

I And then finally, after something
I more than nine pages devoted to the
| Muste ‘“Conference for Progressive
Labor Action” (all nine pages pure
Musteite propaganda) there are six
pages devoted to the Trade Union
Unity League, mostly on the con
vention and draft program, and ad
ded to this, two pages on the Na
tional Industrial Unions and TUUL
industrial leagues, and hidden among
this, appears in a ten line history of
all the tremendous activity of the
N. M. U. in 1929, this sentence: “A
subsequent tri-district convention at
Zcigler, on December 1, called the
miners’ strike of December 9.” Just
that, and nothing more, about a
strike, for which the bosses flooded
Illinois with militia, made hundreds
of arrests, which saw miners march
ing in armies from mine to mine, in
which the I. W. W. (as admitted by
j a passing reference in the article on
j the I. W. W., page 104) made their
1 latest step in degeneration by scab
bing in the southern fields, and for
which, after fierce battles, hundreds
were arrested. The case of the rene
gade John Watt (included in these
10 lines) is given much space
than the Illinois strike.
Nothing stated about the N. M.
U. is false, but you see what we
mean by propaganda when you find
that the fake strike of the' I. L. G.
W., treated as a real strike and high
ly praised by the American Labor
Year Book, gets honorable mention
in the “International Labor Diary”,
for more than half a page is boosted
as an “organization drive” later in
the book, and in both cases largely
in anticipation, for the I. L. G. W.
dressmaker’s fake strike nad not
started in the period the book cov
ers. Likewise a half page is given
the Cloth, Hat, Cap and Millinery
Workers, and both these organiza
tions are described as “jubilant and
in a mood of victory” because “they
have eliminated the Communists.”
And, since, for the sake of an ex
ample, we have entered the needle
I trades, it might be all right to men
tion that the Needle Trades Work
ers Ihdustrial Union gets exactly
two and one third lines, over on
page 102, as follows: “The Needle
Trades Workers Industrial Union
conducted strikes of furriers, cloak
makers and dressmakers in New
York City, and elsewhere.” Not one
of these N. T. W. I. U. strikes are
mentioned in the “International La
bor Diary” though that portion of
the book does declare: “July 11—
Cloakmakers’ Strike of New York
ended; control over shops secured
by International Ladies Garment
Workers Union, with large gain in
membership.” Also the fake strike
gets a page and a quarter, over in
the book under ""Strikes and Lock
outs”. The Gastonia strike and trial
here gets 2 pages, with some inac
curacies; the Illinois miners are not
mentioned.
| Another example of the same sort
is in that “International Labor
Diary.” Under a heading April 2,
the whole Gastonia strike, Aderholt
raid, trial and conviction and sent
encing of seven leaders,' is summed
up in five and one half lines. But
five lines are needed for the harm
less kidnapping of McGrady and
kidnapping of McGrady and Hoff
man of the A. F. L. at Elizabethton!
So, that is enough of that. In
the field where the working class
could expect, from the title and
claims of the Year Book, some de
gree of objectiveness and accuracy,
the examples given above are typical
of the treatment throughout, for all
unions and labor struggles.
When you come to the more di
rectly political aspects of the class
struggle, where Communists and
socialists appear as political bodies,
it is of course too much to expect
any pretense of fairness from a pub
lication run by the socialist party.
Here we have polemical articles
open and unadorned. But even here,
one remarks with amazement such
a handling of the situation as the
following: “The organized Commu
nist movement of the United States
is divided into four groups,” and
then appear, listed on terms of ab
solute equality of importance. Com
munist Party, Lovestone’s organiza
tion, Cannon’s organization, and the
Proletarian Party.
The article on the Soviet Union
is forced to admit progress, but re
peats the slanders of Abramovich,
and represents Tomsky as perse
cuted because of “his opposition to
the turning of the labor organiza
tions, with their more than 11,000,-
000 members into part of the gov
ernment apparatus.” This in the
workers’ own country, where the
government is directly set up end
controlled by the workers and work
ers’ organizations run everything!

Where the Indian Masses Struggle
Delhi is the general capital of British imperialism in India, except
iiu the heat of summer when the viceroy sometimes moves to Simla, in
the northern hills. Peshwar, at the top of the map, is where the first,
mutiny of Indian troops took place, and the British got their biggest
scare. Lahore has been the scene of fighting, it is the big city of the
Punjab, in which most of the Sikhs live. Sikhs have been dispersed
marching to aid the rebels in Peshwar. Amritsar, scene several years
ago of the massacre of hundreds of Indians when the British General
Dwyer turned the machine guns on them, is a few miles east of Lahore,
but is not shown on the map. There has been street fighting in Karachi
and Bombay, chief cities on the west coast. Poona, shown near Bombay,
is a military center for the British. Near Poona Gandhi sits in nominal
confinement, and plots with the British to stop the growing revolt.
Sholapur, seized and held several days by Indian textile workers, is not
shown, but is a couple of hundred miles south of Bombay, near the
coast. The extreme South of India is a sea of reaction, home of the
most defeatist, non-resistant native religions encouraged by the British
government, but even so, sharp street demonstrations, with resistance
to police attacks have taken place in Madras. Calcutta, the big seaport
of the east coast is an industrialized city, and here have centered rail
road strikes, textile strikes, and strikers of carters, many of which led
tc battles with the police and military. Naina, Allahabad, Cawnpore,
Lucknow, Agra, are in the heavily agricultural and industrialized north-,
ern regions where there arc most railways. They arc no centers of
growing revolt, as they were in the days of the “Indian Mutiny,” in the
middle of last century.

Eisenstein Explains Some
Things That Make Sovkino
•‘Soviet Film Art Begins Where the American
Leaves Off”; Hopes to Film “Capital”
By HARRY A. POTAMKIN
Sergei - Michaelovitch Eisenstein,
i Soviet film director, has arrived in
| the U. S. A., with his cameraman,
I Comrade Edouard Tisse. At the end
of the month his co-director, G. W.
I Alexandroff, will follow. They are
i under contract to the Paramount
j Publix producers. Eisenstein’s as
j sistant will be Ivor Montagu, one of
| the founders of the Workers’ Film
I Society of London, composed large
ly of Communists.
Eisenstein was asked: “Will you
make a mass film here?”
He replied: “I hope to.”
i “You do not believe in the love
triangle?”
“What do you mean, believe? It
| exists. But I am not interested in
j it. It isn’t my artistic concern.”
“Wouldn’t you like to make a
j comedy?’
“I would. My work in workers’
theatre of the Proletkult in Moscow
was buffoonery, circus farce. But
I you must understand that the Soviet
J director is interested in comedy as
i social satire. It must serve a social
function.”
“Are American films barred from
f ! Soviet Russia because of their cap
italist viewpoint?”
“American films are not barred
f More are not exhibited because of
| the fantastic prices American pvo
- ; ducers demand. Os course certain
f ■ American films have no place in
' ! our society. You cannot expect us
• to be interested in King of Kings—
-1 it is too far away from our life.
• 1 But we have liked Nanook and Mo
■ ! ana, the films of Chaplin. Chap
• I lin’s long films we have not seen
i because of their formidable prices.
’ I think his Woman of Paris a mile
stone in the development of the ci-
I ! nema, although I have condemned
i Soviet directors for following it too
+ literally. Its attitude, content and
' 1 form should not have influenced a
kino such as ours, with mass prob
■ j lems and social perspective.”
J' “Will the U. S. S. R. make talk
ies? And if so will the international
'appeal of her films be destroyed?”
“Os course we will make talkies.
‘ But they will not be dialogue films,
j Speech will be but a small and dis
j tributed part of the sound. The
j sound and speech will be synchro
| nized after the visual portion is
•• I filmed. We will not time the speech
e ! to the lip-movements. Nor will we
have only people speaking. The
; rivers and fields will talk too. Not
. duplicate naturalism but dispropor
j tion. Other languages can be in
! serted for the Russian. The inter
“‘nationalism is preserved. Our sound
technique is already present in our
, j silent technique, in montage. Mon
‘ | tage is the mounting of the film,
s the combining of the single images
or frames of the negative into a
progressive composition. Our film-:
. | making begins where the American
] j ends.
.! We wanted something more
e | than just a physiognomy, something
:1 I more than just grimaces or actions,
. jwe wantetd to convey a sense that
e I would remain after the physical
3 image had passed, an ‘overtone’, as
it is called in music.”
I
II “Would you not say that this sense
n is achieved not by plan but by an ‘
y ; inner feeling?”
e “No, I would not. It is true that
e individual sensibility is important,
but a method of overtone can be
t formulated like mathematics for
others to follow. At the State Tech
. nical Institute of the Cinema in
Moscow, where 1 taught the theory
. and practice of motion picture di
rection, we instruct the students ac
cording to such a method. They are
■, | taught in laboratory-fashion, by
,! selection and relation, where to place ;
s j the door, left or right, and why.
How to select and relate physiogno
i ‘ lilies for their resonance.”
i. ! China Express is a result of this j
L j education.
r | Actors ? “I select types from
I non-professionals. In. the combina
tion, not in the histrionics, is the
| film realized. Martha Lapkina, the
> peasant-woman in Old and New,
; was, of course, an exceptional in
stance. She experienced all that
jwe desired.”
I Effect on audiences? Eisenstein
now speaks as head of the Cinema
Division of the Psycho-Physical
I Laboratories for the study of audi
jence relations:
“Effect is relative. In a battle
scene, instead of showing men slain,
’ I wished to convey the physical hor
ror by the butchery of cows. Re
fined cosmopolitans shuddered, but
[peasants, accustomed to the
i slaughter of cattle, were not
j touched. This admittedly makes
; the problem difficult in the Soviet
Lnion, due to the diversity of audi
ehce, but we are meeting the diffi
culty by making special films with
specific appeals, instead of manu
facturing least common denomina
tor pictures for everybody.”
“Will you make a film of Marx’s
Capital as you intended? Old and
New leads directly to it.”
""I hope to.”
Eisenstein has, in this brief in-!
[ terview. expressed, not only him- 1
sell', but the Soviet cinema gener
ally. And the Soviet cinema ex
presses, of course, the Soviet social
mind. The October Revolution gave
birth to the Soviet film. Motion
pictures had been made prior to the
| foundation of the U. S. S. R., but
lihey are beyond recollection. The
j'estiges of these pre-revolutionary
I film-days clutter the movie machin-i
] ery of Europe. The work of these
| emigre directors is over-adorned
] hokum mainly. These spurious art
j ists are fragments of an empire.
I The veritable Russian artist of the
cinema is the utterance of the revo
lution. Had there been no revolu
tion, and had Eisenstein turned to
the film—which is itself improbable
he might have made another
version of Oscar Wilde’s The Pic
ture of Dorian Grey, that expres
! sion of an introverted aristocracy
which was made into a movie in
pre-Soviet days by Meierhold, the
j stage director of Moscow, whose
' assistant Eisenstein was prior to
i entering the films.
The life-history of Eisenstein
reads dialectically. From an eng-
I ineering institute to da Vinci and
! Freud. The engineering corps of
the Red Army, and the Red Army’s
i theatrical companies as designer
I and director. The academy of the
! general staff in the Japanese sec
; tion. The influence of the Japanese
j theatre and language. Dramatiza
. tion and production of Jack Lon
don’s The Mexican for the Prolet
j kult, first workers’ theatre. Meier
hold. Counter-Meierhold. The films.
Pavlov’s psychology. Marx’s mater
i ialism. The last gave him the syn
thetic instrument. He extracted
from his intellectual experienc their
materialist content. Some day he
hopes to write his findings on aest
hetics from the materialistic view
point. His films have increasingly
| been dialectic structures. He has
j said that the future cinema will con
cern itself with “conflict-conjunc
i tions” (the antithesis-synthesis of
J dialectics) of an intellectual appeal,
j But the basis is already present in
j the primitive film. He sees the Sov
j iet cinema has “having composed a
j completely new form of cinemato
! graphy—the insertion of revolution
into the general history of culture;
| having composed a synthesis of sci
i ence, art and militant class feeling.”

""Carthage Must Be
Destroyed ”
Long time ago , about twenty ecu- \
turies, a Roman noble in a fancy
nightshirt kept hollering that “Car
thage must be destroyed!’’ And '
damned if it wasn’t. We read about i
it Wednesday, when the papers toid
us that thousands of Catholics de
scended upon it —you see it is in
Tunis, North Africa —for the Thir • ;
tieth International Eucharistic Con- \
gress. French imperialism has the I
natives hog-tied now, and there arc
no Gods of Baal more savage and
bloody than modern imperialists. So
French troops and fleet turned out
to give the key of Tunis—the mod
ern city near the ruins of ancient
Carthage—to the Papal Legate, j
Forty thousand Catholic notables—
including 500 from Hooverland—
flooded the place. We mean flooded, j
since—say the papers—“ The govern- j
ment aided the wine merchants by:
handing out booklets describing the
charms of Tunisian wines.’’ Alas, i
the “blood of the redeemer” they
hand out in New York ain’t to be
compared to the vintage squeezed
out of the Tunis grapes by the in
fidel hands of Arabs. A good time
was had by all and the Arabs ""did
a profitable business.’’ We’ll bet the
Arabs thq/yght: ""Well, it may be alt
right to destroy Carthage, but why
abuse the remains?""

I Think It's Because They

About that headline on a local
paper which says that “fresh pol

ian strike. They're like that:
Look at Whalen! Just look at
him! He, too, was fresh, until he
collided with the Daily Worker
forgery exposures. Since then he
has been using all his massive
brain to prevent the hen from
crossing the road against the red,

Make an Art of
I
1 Slave Driving
By M. S. (Chicago).
In working for the Atlantic and
Pacific Tea Company for over a
year I have come in touch with dif
ferent workers but with same opin
i ions. They all know how low their
: wages are and how long the hours
are. They are always ready to dis
cuss their conditions which »r a
very bad. The wages for women
is $15.00 a week. The hours are
10 Va during the week, and 12 hours
on Saturday. Twice a week we are
forced to work overtime for 1 or 2
hours without extra pay. When the
grocery .order comes in we are forced
to put it up for the next day. The
maangers of these stores are the
real slave drivers for the company.
They are paid a wage with a certain
commission on the sales for the
week. When -a new worker is hired
j the manager gives the lowest wage
[which he can get away with. The
manager makes them work overtime
! for less pay, then keeps this extra
money for himself.
Twice a year they have contests
| in the stores, to see which store will
[ make the biggest profit for the bos
jses. Then each manager goes to
! his clerks and tells them how won
iderful it will be if their store wins
: the prize.
During the summer season busi
ness drops considerably, which re
j suits in the lay-off of men workers
[and the lowering of wages for those
! who remain. Those wo do not want
! to accept a lower wage are forced
Ito quit working. The company
I never suffers a loss but as usual,
! the unorganized workers are forced
!to bear the result of the slack sea
j son by a cut in their wages.
The workers who buy in these
‘ stores are cheated in the worst
fashion. The manager has to make
'up for the food that spoils, so he
makes his clerks cheat on scales and
i prices so as to make up for any
I loss. •
The clerks have to stand for all
i kinds of insults from the customers.
I The company has the slogan “The
j customers are always right” and we
| are forced to abide by this and not
argue with them if they blame us
‘for anything, we must try in every
j way to please them so as not to
I lose business. Besides waiting on
i customers we are forced to keep the
'store clean. We never have a min
iute’s rest. The company superin
j tendent comes around every once in
1 o while. When the manager knows
I that he is coming he makes us work
J much harder so as to have the store
j nice and clean when he comes.
The only way for the men and
women workers in these chain stores
[is to organize. They must speak
I with one another and not let the
boss separate them.
As class-conscious workers we
must popularize our demands be
fore all workers in all trades. Only
as an organized group will we be
able to get our demands which are:
seven hour day, five day week, social
insurance 'or the unemployed, equal
pay for equal work, etc.
We must join the industrial unions
of the Trade Union Unity League,
the militant trade union center of
the U. S. A.
Demand the release of Fos
ter, Minor, Amter and Ray
mond, in prison for fighting
for unemployment insurance.
The Flames of Discontent
Among the things classified as
adding insult to injury, we reckon
the burning of six policemenl at
Sholapur, India,—it must be said,
died miserably for the sake of
British imperialism, being soaked
in kerosene and set fire to by
Hindus who—strangely enough—
were irritated at being fired on
with rifles. The insult was inci
dental, originating from the ru
mor we don’t certify, that the
kerosene was the product of the
Standard Oil Company and not of
the Royal Dutch Shell, and more
over had been purchased from the
Soviet Oil Trust by Standard Oil
to supply fuel to its competition
against the Shell interests in In
dia.
